 ### Features Left to Implement

 - Would like to add a number beside each list item which increases according to the number of items on the list, as well as the already included counter at the top of the list.
 - Would like to improve app layout on smaller screens in future to reduce the need for the user to scroll.
 - Favicon nto displaying properly on live site so had to remove for now as also causing console errors.


## Testing

- Main input field and add button kept popping out of the container on smaller screen sizes. Changed CSS property on input field to 100% of container size to rectify issue.
- Errors in html validator after making social icons live caused by open tags. Rectified tags as needed.
- Tested app live on Samsung Galaxy S22 and found instructions were not fully visbale on smaller screens as they would not scroll. Amended html markup to rectify.
- Social icons and links too close to margins on smaller screens, inserted media quueries to compensate.
- Removed redundent variables cuasing warning in jshint, updated js with es6 code to prevent es6 related errors using const.
- Portrait on medium to small screens hding the input field and could not be accessed. Added scroll to Y axis and allowed input field to move as items added to list to compensate.
- Favicon not displaying unless files are in root directory. Chose to have favicon and leave files in root directory.
